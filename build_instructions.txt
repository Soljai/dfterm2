Some simple build instructions for dfterm2.

Last updated 2010/6/18.

I have compiled and ran dfterm2 on Windows and Fedora 13.

To compile dfterm2 you need (at least):

ICU libraries (often libicu or libicu-dev, libicu-devel)
PCRE
CMake  (version 2.8)
OpenSSL
Gcc or MinGW's version of gcc

On Windows I found that getting the dependencies to compile
and work was much, much harder than compiling dfterm2 itself.
At least I had to manually remove -ansi and -pedantic from ICU when
I compiled it with MinGW/MSys.

Remember to check out Trankesbel roguelike support library before trying
to compile dfterm2. On Linux (or git/MSys):

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

On Linux, this hopefully works then for compiling dfterm2:

$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./dfterm2

On Windows, you may need to manually set some of the compiler parameters,
so that it can find the libraries it needs. CMake has a nice GUI, which you can use.
Refer to CMake's manual.
