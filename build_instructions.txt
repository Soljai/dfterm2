Some simple build instructions for dfterm2.

Last updated 2010/5/21.

I have compiled and ran dfterm2 on Windows and Fedora 13.
As of writing of this, it doesn't work properly on Linux but it runs
and you'll be able to connect to it.

To compile dfterm2 you need (at least):

ICU libraries (often libicu or libicu-dev, libicu-devel)
PCRE
CMake  (version 2.8)
Gcc or MinGW's version of gcc

On Windows I found that getting the dependencies to compile
and work was much, much harder than compiling dfterm2 itself.
At least I had to manually remove -ansi and -pedantic from ICU when
I compiled it with MinGW/MSys.

Remember to check out Trankesbel roguelike support library before trying
to compile dfterm2. On Linux (or git/MSys):

$ git submodule init
$Â git submodule update

On Linux, this hopefully works then for compiling dfterm2:

$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./dfterm2

On Windows, you may need to manually set some of the compiler parameters,
so that it can find the libraries it needs. CMake has a nice GUI, which you can use.
Refer to CMake's manual.
