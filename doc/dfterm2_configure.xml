<title>dfterm2_configure command line tool</title>

<para>
Dfterm2 is bundled with a command line tool called dfterm2_configure.
You configure some aspects of dfterm2 with it. It is the only way to
create new admin accounts, apart from dfterm2 installer on Windows.
It must be used on Linux systems to create an admin account.
</para>
<para>
Dfterm2 uses an sqlite3 database file to store all its settings. Dfterm2_configure writes to this database. You should not run dfterm2_configure, while dfterm2 itself is running.
</para>
<para>
Dfterm2_configure should be where dfterm2 is. On Windows, it is installed in the same directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\dfterm2). Use the Windows command line program (cmd.exe) to navigate there. On Linux, dfterm2_configure sits in the same directory where dfterm2 was compiled.
</para>
<para>
You can get help of all command line parameters by using the --help switch.

C:\Program Files\dfterm2> dfterm2_configure --help    (Windows)
$ ./dfterm2_configure --help                          (Linux)
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
On Windows, the database is located in %APPDATA\dfterm2\dfterm2.database
For example, on author's computer, this is C:\Users\Mikko\AppData\Roaming\dfterm2 (Windows 7). To use dfterm2_configure with it, you would write this, if you wanted to clear all address restriction settings.

<programlisting>
C:\Program Files\dfterm2> dfterm2_configure --database C:\Users\Mikko\AppData\Roaming\dfterm2\dfterm2.database  --removeaddressrestrictions
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
On Linux, the default database is in the current directory where dfterm2 runs with the name dfterm2_database.sqlite3. Dfterm2_configure also uses this file by default.
